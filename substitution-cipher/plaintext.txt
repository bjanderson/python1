Software is a collection of instructions and data that tell a computer how to work.
This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the work.
In computer science and software engineering, software is all information processed by computer systems, including programs and data.
Software includes programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media.
Software and hardware require each other and neither can be realistically used on their own.
